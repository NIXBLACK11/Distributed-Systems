# Distributed Systems

I will try to go into depth into this distributed systems, folowing the youtube course provided by MIT, some papers and a roadmap i brainstormed with chatgpt.

The language of choice is Golang so you can expect to see some Golang ralated topics throughout.

This will be divided into multiple weeks, not specifically completed in one week but what i grouped it to be.

This also has a folder containing links to all the reading resources that fits into this that i found helpful.

I will also try to fit examples of techniques i have applied at real world places.

Some topis i have already coevered so wont be detailed but will surely will be linked.

This is not necessarily a course of any sort just a thing I created.
